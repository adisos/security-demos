## Introduction

Welcome to our demo environment, where we showcase our comprehensive approach to securing modern application architectures. In this environment, we focus on critical areas of security: Applying Security Best practices ( Or not ), vulnerability management, runtime detection and response, network segmentation, defence in depth, and applying the least privileges. The demo environment also includes runtime detection and response capabilities, allowing you to detect and respond to threats in real time, including detecting zeroday attacks. Finally, our demo environment showcases the importance of network segmentation in securing modern application architectures.
